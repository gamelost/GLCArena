# GLCArena

GLC on Unreal Engine 4. This is an experimental UE4 level for competitive multiplayer combat.

When you commit a Blueprints change, *please* screenshot it and add it
to the screenshots folder. This is currently the only (hacky) way we
can resolve merge conflicts, short of custom git plugins and
dropbox/link shell extension hackery.
